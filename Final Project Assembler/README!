Explanation of the files:
The assembler file is the main file and from it the calls are sent to the functions that handle the received file and at the end (if the file is correct) output files are issued. 

The preAssembler file contains the main functions that handle the deployment of the macros and from it calls are sent to the auxiliary functions that help handle the received file. The functions also export the newly unzipped file.

The first pass file contains, among other things, the main function that performs the first pass and from which calls are sent to the auxiliary functions that help handle the file in the first pass.

The second pass file contains the three main functions of the second pass: the function that checks the errors of the second pass and encodes symbols and the functions that create the ent, ext files.

The second pass also sends calls to the helper functions.

The utils file is the file that contains the utility functions of the first and second pass.

The macroLists file contains the helper functions of the preAssemble.

The convert file contains the function that converts the decimal encoding from the instruction and data sets to base 64 encoding and finally creates the appropriate object file.
 
In addition, 5 test files are attached:
A preAssemblerError file that examines the errors handled by the preassembler and outputs error messages.
firstPassError file that examines the errors handled in the first pass and outputs error messages.
A secondPassError file that examines the errors handled in the second pass and outputs error messages.
A warningsTest file that examines the handled warnings and finally outputs output files.
A validTest file which is a valid assembly language file and outputs output files.

All output files are in the outputFiles folder.
